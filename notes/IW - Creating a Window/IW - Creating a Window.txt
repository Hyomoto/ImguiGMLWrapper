ImguiGML Wrapper - Creating a window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a. Module Overview
b. Example

a. Module Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The window feature of the wrapper is accessed through imgui.window and contains the following functions:

open( id, function )
- Opens a window with the given id using the provided function.


close( id )
- Closes the window with the given id if it exists.


invert( id, function )
- Opens or closes the window depending on its current state.


is_open( id )
- Returns true if the window with the given id is currently open.


Additionally, the window constructor may contain the following variables to affect window behavior:

handle
- This is the name that will be shown on the window.

open
- If set to false, the window will not have the minimize/close buttons.

flags
- The EImGui_WindowFlags to apply to the window.

a. Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows are defined using constructor functions.  They can then be opened by calling:

imgui.window.open( "My Window", MyWindowFunction );


The function itself must contain a `show()` method.  This is what is called by the imgui wrapper when
the window is open.  If you would like the window to be closed, you can return IMGUI_WINDOW_CLOSE.


function MyWindowFunction( _mode, _data ) {
	show	= function() {
		imguigml_text( "Hello There!" );
		
		if ( imguigml_button( "Close" ))
			return IMGUI_WINDOW_CLOSE;
		
	}
	handle	= "My Window";
	
}


There is also one optional method, `setup()` which will be called before the menu code.  This can be
used if there is code that must be run before the window is declared, this generally includes
function calls that affect the window such as imguigml_set_next_window_size().
